    Number used as logic:                    1,285 out of   9,112   14%
      Number using O6 output only:           1,264
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                   21
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   451 out of   2,278   19%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of   4,556    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,294
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           516 out of   1,294   39%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   9 out of   1,294    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         769 out of   1,294   59%
    Number of unique control sets:               3
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               6 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
