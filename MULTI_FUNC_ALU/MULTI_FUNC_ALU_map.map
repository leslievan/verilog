WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net ALU_OP[2]_GND_3_o_Mux_16_o
   is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the
   CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           18
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            17 out of      18   94%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               7 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
